GoogleEarth Tools
-----------------
View cursor position, selected features or whole layer in the Google Earth
application.

Plugin creates KML file, containing cursor position, selected feature(s)
or whole vector layer and opens this file in the Google Earth desktop application.
Also it supports raster layers, but currently only those that are loaded via
QGIS GDAL provider.

It is possible to preserve vector layer styling (considering KML limitations),
as well as use custom styling for all types of vector features.
